##Nuclear eDNA project

Goal: to identify high depth/repetition genomic regions present in Atlantic Salmon anod not present in other salmonids.
Starting with Arctic Charr and Atantic Salmon because we have that data on hand. 

Workflow to estimate depth windows is [here](https://github.com/TonyKess/nuclearEDNA/blob/main/depthestimation_workflow.md)

R script for depth comparisons between species is [here](https://github.com/TonyKess/nuclearEDNA/blob/main/salmon_charr_depthcompare.R)
